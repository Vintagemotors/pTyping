# Releases 
Select the branch you want and then go to the actions tab and download the artifact you want. Alternatively, releases for what appears to be the most recent branch are here: https://github.com/Vintagemotors/pTyping/releases
# Configuration 
A save button for the settings menu does not appear to have been implemented yet so after first run you can exit and go to /config/ptyping.cfg and manually specify your settings 
# Known issues 
After completing a song and hitting back you may not be able to select another song to play. To fix this for now hit escape once to take you back to the main menu then click play again and you will be able to select the song you want to play next. 
Modifiers clear themselves after going back to the main menu. 
There is no way to set the scroll independent of the song playback rate. (would make text much more readable on LCD monitors, for now it is strongly advised to either use a very high refresh rate or a CRT to avoid eye pain.
# Modifiers 
Click the clock with an empty battery to set a speed lower than 1.0 or the clock with a weird blurred hand to set a speed higher than 1.0
